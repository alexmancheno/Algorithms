Below is the algorithm steps for the bubble sort:

Step 0: include and declare everything that are needed for the program
Step 1: open the input file, data.txt // the file you had created in question 6.
Step 2: read from the input file and count the number of integers in the file, and store the number in an   integer variable, named, dataCount.
Step 3: close the input file
Step 4: dynamically (no credits for other wise) allocate an integer array, named dataSorted, with the size of dataCount  //result in Stept 2 
Step 5: open the input file, data.txt, again
Step 6: read from the input file one integer at a time (no credits for reading one text line at a time) 
	and store the integer in the arrary  dataSorted
Step 7: set startIndex  to  0 
            Set endIndex  to dataCount – 1
Step 8: set walkerIndex to  startIndex
Step 9: if dataSorted[walkerIndex] > dataSorted[walkerIndex + 1]
     Set temp to  dataSorted[walkerIndex]
                  Set dataSorted[walkerIndex] to dataSorted[walkerIndex + 1]
                  Set dataSort[walkerIndex + 1] to temp
Step 10: walkerIndex ++
Step 11: repeat Step 9 and Step 10 until walkerIndex >= endIndex
Step 13: endIndex --
Step 14: repeat Step 8 to Step 13 until endIndex <= startIndex

Step 15: open an output file, be named, bubbleSort
Step 16: write the content of the array, dataSorted, to the file bubbleSort
